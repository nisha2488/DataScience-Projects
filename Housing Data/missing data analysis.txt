Fix missing values for below using None or 0 instead of NA:
(Check with TA that if the data itself contains NA, how is it given in the dataset - 'NA' or simply NA. Since it may be mixed up)
Alley: 'None' (both)
BsmtFullBath : 0 (has NA for 2 rows with no basement) (test)
BsmtHalfBath : 0 (has NA for 2 rows with no basement) (test)
FireplaceQu : 'None' (has NA for all houses with 0 fireplaces) (both)
Fence: 'None' (both)

Action 1: Fix missing values in train + test data
Fix missing values for below using mice
Lot Frontage
MSZoning
Utilities
Exterior1st
Exterior2nd
Electrical
KitchenQual
SaleType

Fix using both approaches:

MasVnr related attributes - 
Split MasVnr related attributes into training and test datasets:
Training data:
MasVnrType : 'None'
MasVnrArea : 0

Test data:
MasVnrType : 'None' for 15 records where area is NA. Remaining 1 by mice
MasVnrArea : 0

Basement related attributes:
Split basement related attributes into training and test datasets:
Basement or no basement is decided using the attribute TotalBsmtSF. If TotalBsmtSF = 0, then no basement.
Training data:
BsmtQual = 'None'
BsmtCond = 'None'
BsmtExposure = 'None' for 37 rows that have no basement
BsmtFinType1 = 'None'
BsmtFinType2 = 'None' for 37 rows that have no basement

Test data: Has one record which has NA for TotalBsmtSF. Replace it with zero and the corresponding 3 basement area columns as well with 0. Thus, total no basement records in test data = 0 + NA rows = 42 rows
BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF and TotalBsmtSF = 0
BsmtQual = 'None' for 42 rows that have no basement
BsmtCond = 'None' for 42 rows that have no basement
BsmtExposure = 'None' for 42 rows that have no basement
BsmtFinType1 = 'None'
BsmtFinType2 = 'None' 

Remaining NA values for basement related attributes to be fixed using mice

Garage related attributes:
Training data:
GarageType, GarageYrBlt, GarageFinish, GarageQual, GarageCond: 'None'

Test data:
GarageType: 'None' for all 76 rows with NA
GarageYrBlt: 'None' for 76 with no garage type
GarageFinish: 'None' for 76 with no garage type
GarageCar: To be predicted for the only 1 NA value in the test dataset
GarageArea: To be predicted for the only 1 NA value in the test dataset
GarageQual: 'None' for 76 with no garage type
GarageCond: 'None' for 76 with no garage type

Pool related attributes:
Training data:
PoolQC = 'None' for all 1453 houses since pool area = 0 for all these records

Test data:
PoolQC = 'None' for 1453 rows where pool area = 0
Remaining 3 to be predicted using mice

Miscellaneous attributes:
Training data:
MiscFeature: 'None' (all these NA rows have 0 misc value)

Test Data:
MiscFeature: None for 1407 rows where Misc Valu = 0
Remaining one to be predicted using mice
