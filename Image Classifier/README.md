The task was to identify the correct orientation of a given test image. Implemented k nearest neighbors algorithm to predict the orientation of a given image using the
training dataset consisting of images and their correct orientation. The main code is in the file orient.py wherein three different solutions for this problem have been implemented using below techniques:
1. kNN Classifier
2. AdaBoost
3. Neural Network Classifier

## Note:    

Please look at the report for detailed analysis.    

### command to run best model.
