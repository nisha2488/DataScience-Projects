KNN:

- kNN classifier problem formulation and code details:
Since kNN does not involve training part, we directly start reading the images from the test dataset.
As part of testing, given a test image, the classifier calculates the Euclidean distance between each pixel of the test image and
the image in the training dataset. It then adds the distance found for all pixels between a given test image and image in the 
training dataset to get the Total Distance from that training image.
It does this for all images in the training dataset, i.e., it compares a given image with all the images in the training dataset.
After computing the total distance for all images in the training dataset, it finds the k (k set to 200 in the code) images for which 
the Total Distance is the least for a given test image.
It then checks for the orientation of these k nearest neighbors found above and gets the orientation which occurs most frequent for these neighbors.
It thus returns this orientation for the test image.
Say, if k=10 and out of the 10 images, which have least Total Distance for the given test image, 7 images are oriented at 90 degrees,
then the test image is classified to be oriented at 90 degrees.
In this way, the classifier identifies the orientation for all images in the test dataset.

Few changes made to the above ideal k nearest neighbor algorithm are as below:
1. Since comparing the test image against all the images in the training dataset takes a long time (nearly 50 minutes),
we have reduced the number of comparisons by checking only for the pixels at the four edges of the image, i.e., 
top, bottom, left and right edge of the images are considered while comparing a given test image with an image in the training dataset.
This reduced the execution time to nearly 15 minutes. The details of all the experimentation are included in the assignment report.

2. To reduce the execution time further, we updated the formula for calculating the Euclidean distance.
Since we are adding up the distance (found for each pixel) to find the Total Distance for a training image,
we can avoid taking the square root of this distance value.

Please Note:
1. The execution time for kNN was around 15 minutes on the burrow server, however, based on the number of processes running on the server, time may vary.
(We got 12 minutes as the best execution time so far.)
But still, the classifier should not take more than 30 minutes, even in the worst case, to give results.

2. We have calculated the value of k as the square root of the total number of images in the test dataset-
k = int(math.sqrt(train_length * 4))
(train_length is the number of distinct images in the train dataset and thus multiplying by 4 we get the total number of training images)
This returns k = 192. However, the code gave better results for k=200.
Thus, we have added 8 to the above found k value in the code. 
If the same code is used with a different training dataset, please comment this line in the code where we have added 8 to k.
This will ensure that k is set to the square root of the total number of images in this new training dataset.

Results of kNN classifier:

       0  180  270   90
0    172   30   17   15
180   33  168   18   18
270   19   14  179   26
90    15   24   30  165
Classification accuracy of kNN:72.53%

Design decisions made:
There were certain parameters that we had to decide for kNN. These include the value of k, the fraction of dataset to use.
We have included all the details for these design decisions in the report. However, we found the best results 
by only comparing the edges of the images in the training and test dataset and by setting k=200. 


ADABOOST:

The problem is here to predict the orientation of a given image.

Our Model:
1.) We first select a combination of random indexes, which is our model.
2.) We then compare the pixel values of those indexes and check whether if point 1 > point 2
	If it is so, then we have correctly classified the images
	Else, misclassified.
3.) We do this over and over again for each orientation by updating weights at each step which are initialised
	to be 1/total_number_of_files at the begining.
4.) We calculate the alpha value (weight of this classifier), which is a function of error.
5.) We create n stumps for each orientation
6.) While testing, we take each record and run it through our set of classifiers and the orientation for which
	the classifiers results the best, we choose that orientation.

Our idea is to build a collection of weak classifiers to form a strong one.

As we see, that the accuracy is relatively low when the number of stumps are less, since the collection collectively
is not strong enough but once it goes above 20, accuracy hits 65% or so and continues to remain the same.

Result of 200 stumps:

Confusion Matrix:
       0  180  270   90
0    170   47   43   39

270   13   15  148   22
90    18   12   28  133


NERUAL NET:
Following is the implementation of neural network for binary classification.  
- Implemented back propogation to train the network   
- using sigmoid activation function.  
- Using gradient ascent principle to update all the  weights between layers.   
- Implement softmax function in feed forward network to make the predictions of probabilities
